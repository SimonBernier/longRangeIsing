Moving front quenches in long-range transverse field Ising (LR-TFI) models

Code used to make the figures in our paper (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.024310)

critical calculates the critical ground state properties

gapLR calculated the energy gap. Used to find the critical point, the critical exponents and test the approximation of algebraic interactions by a sum of exponentials

staticFront calculates the ground state energy and correlations for a static front (not used in paper)

superluminal calculates the energy, correlations and von Neumann entanglement property during an inhomogeneous quench using a quench front moving at constant velocity. Time evolution is done with 4th time dependent variational principle

vCrit calculates the von Neumann entanglement entropy after a local perturbation of the ground state of LR-TFI models. Used to find the speed of light of the models
